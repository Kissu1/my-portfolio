## Example Portfolio Template :sparkles:

I wanted to create a template that I could potentially use for creating portfolio sites. Essentially it's an example portfolio! 
Some of the images already have the gradient borders around them which I added in Figma instead of doing it via Tailwind

## Frameworks :hammer:
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
- Next.js 
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## Deployment :zap:
- Will be deploying using Vercel

Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
